## Hierarchical Data v.s. Categorical Data v.s. Multi-dimension Data
层次数据和分类数据多维数据

可视元素可以有重叠，但是要可以通过交互方式从混乱中提取信息，避免完全重叠的情况。

## Quantum Treemap: rectagle内部可以放置内容

## Focus Switch

[the brain][]

## Stack Approach

TimeRadialTree

## a consistent set of interaction techniques

## Increamental Exploration

> Incremental exploration requires users to make decisions
about where to go based on the information they have at
any given time. -- [TreePlus][TreePlus]

- `TouchGraph` layout algorithm

## The use of Background Color, Opacity, Shadow and Texture
> The transparency techniques have been used in a number of 3D
visualization systems, such as the Information Cube,Cone-Tree
and the Spiral Calendar,etc. These applications mainly aim to
solve the overlapping problem.

## Suggestion Based Technique

- [TreePlus: Interactive Exploration of Networks with Enhanced Tree Layouts][TreePlus]
		
	> "plant a seed and watch it grow"

- [Vizster: Visualizing Online Social Networks][vizster]

	> "start with what you know, then grow"

## History Based Technique

## Context View and Focus View
ACD Image Browser

刚开始不需要为用户提供一个最优的方案，而是在一个简单的原型上，
通过交互让用户探索自己需要的东西。

给用户以选择，让用户选择去除什么，留下什么

## Problems

_What are the Common Used Techniques and their characterristics in Vis?
these techniques are suitable for what kind of data?
what kind of character or pattern are these techniques aimed to?_
